Screenshot Math Timer:  This is to remind me that I can have a "drum roll page" before the final result is shown.  I like the way this timer is 3 seconds long and very clean.  It's a circle like my countdown timer, but with a blank screen.  I see this at times in apps.  

Anyways, my idea here is to have a little "**Vine video**" of a something like someone playing a drum roll or a drum roll animation with maybe the same clean background.  


Deco Intro screen: This is the 1st page of their Intro screen, comes up before the app
"Your network at a glance" - this actually contains a video this is very smart!  I could record myself using the app and this could be the video.   Or it could be an animation or video from anywhere.  

**Background video** in the intro?  Your trying to give the impression of a **beach/waves**, why not a video then?  Very simple small video, 3MB.  Pexels likely have them. It would look very cool.


Other Ideal ideas to move to tasks...

**Bottom Help font**.  If you're gonna go blue background, don't use black font?  Too plain.  

INFO in **caps**, no caps!!   In fact I don't need info at all, get rid of it.  

Hide Bottom help initially?

And have some kind of hopping Swipe Up Animation**?

In the intro text, have a bit where you say "swipe up for help on any page"  Maybe you can have some background on the 1st page so they know how to get help.  This is where a bounce animation animation.  Youre the Reanimated king!  I can do a bounce, just install re-aniamted.  


Separate Welcome to Ideal and the 1st info page, into TWO pages.  You've actually busted your own simple as possible concept by having clutter on the 1st page.  Continue the wizard, use the same background image, but tell a mini- story.    Maybe even every paragraph is a slide.  

Welcome to Ideal text -> **Fade In animation**?  So it looks cool/sexy

The font has to be in a "**text bubble**" with a **background**.  Yes this will cover the image, but it'll be too much of an issue right?  At least on the info style pages(Let's ask some questions), it's not right anyways .  

Replace left/right buttons entirely?  Is swiping obvious?  Put "Swipe to continue" at the bottom instead.
